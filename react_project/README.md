This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Title

This project is called Carpool Coordinator and uses the Google Map API to convert addresses to coordinates and displays markers on an interactive map. 

The goal of this project is to help groups of people coordinate rides. There are both driver and passenger markers on the interactive map. A user can assign passenger markers to a driver based on location.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was started by my husband and his boy scout troop. They have activities every Wednesday and needed help to coordinate rides for boys who did not have a way to get to activities.

## Tech/framework used

Built with React

## Features

With this App, I am creating a file import function which takes in a google sheet with names and addresses, and fills out the lists and map with a touch of a button. 

## Code Example 
Implementation of Google Map in React using react-google-maps

```
<GoogleMap defaultZoom={11}
            defaultCenter={props.driverList.length > 0 ? {lat: props.driverList[0].lat, lng: props.driverList[0].lng}: center}>
        
    {props.driverList.map((object, index)=> {
        if(props.driverList.length >0){
            return (
                <Marker position={{lat: object.lat, lng: object.lng}} key={index} 
                        onClick={()=>{setSelectDriver(object)}}
                        icon={{ url: "https://storage.needpix.com/rsynced_images/icon-2070748_1280.png",
                        scaledSize: new window.google.maps.Size(35, 50)}}/>           
            )
        }   
    })
    }
    {selectDriver && (
        <InfoWindow position={{lat: (selectDriver.lat), lng: selectDriver.lng}        onCloseClick= {()=> setSelectDriver(null)}>
            <div>
                <p><span>{selectDriver.name}</span><br/>{selectDriver.address}</p>
            </div>   
        </InfoWindow>
    )} 
```

## How to use?

To use this app, a user must have the names and addresses of the people they want to find on the map. On the home page they can enter in the names and addresses of both drivers and passengers. They can then navigate to the map and interact with the driver and passenger markers. The Passenger markers will show the driver they are assigned to in their infoWindow. At first, all the passenger markers will be unassigned. So the user can click on the unassigned hyperlink and then assign them to one of the drivers. When a marker is assigned, it turns blue and the user can navigate to the assigned list page afterwards to see all the assignments.
